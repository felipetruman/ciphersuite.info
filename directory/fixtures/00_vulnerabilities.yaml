  fields:
    severity: 2
    description: 'IETF has officially prohibited RC4 for use in TLS in RFC 7465. Therefore, it can be considered insecure.'

  pk: 'Data Encryption Standard'
  fields:
    severity: 2
    description: 'DES is considered weak, primarily due to its short key-lengths of 40 or 65-Bit. Furthermore, it has been withdrawn as a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2005.'

  pk: 'Triple-DES'
  fields:
    severity: 1
    description: 'While Triple-DES is still recognized as a secure symmetric-key encryption, a more and more standardizations bodies and projects decide to deprecate this algorithm. Though not broken, it has been proven to suffer from several vulnerabilities in the past (see [sweet32.info](https://sweet32.info)).'

  pk: 'Non-ephemeral Diffie-Hellman'
  fields:
    severity: 1
    description: 'Diffie-Hellman key exchanges not using ephemeral keys do not support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) which is recommended, so attackers cannot decrypt the whole communication stream.'
- model: directory.Vulnerability
  pk: 'Cipher Block Chaining'
  fields:
    severity: 1
    description: 'In 2013, researchers demonstrated a timing attack against several TLS implementations using the CBC encryption algorithm (see [isg.rhul.ac.uk](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/Lucky13.html)). Additionally, the CBC mode is vulnerable to plain-text attacks in TLS 1.0, SSL 3.0 and lower. A fix has been introduced with TLS 1.2 in form of the GCM mode which is not vulnerable to the BEAST attack. GCM should be preferred over CBC.'

  pk: 'RSA Authentication'
  fields:
    severity: 0
    description: 'There are reports that servers using the RSA authentication algorithm with keys longer than 3072-bit may experience heavy performance issues leading to connection timeouts and even service unavailability if many clients open simultaneous connections.'
